# PHOTO PICKER

I made this quick program to help myself while I'm filtering photos. The functioning is pretty easy:
- Copy the program in the folder you want to filter with all the pictures BE AWARE THAT IT WILL CHANGE ALL THE NAMES
- Lunch the program. It will ask you to prompt the photo names and a grading.
- To close the program type "q 0"

### BE AWARE THAT IT DOES NOT RETAIN INFORMATION BETWEEN SESSIONS. IF YOU LUNCH THE PROGRAM 2 TIMES IN THE SAME FOLDER, THE TEXT FILE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
